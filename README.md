# React Router Dom - Missing Link to Home Page

This repository demonstrates a common but easily missed error in React Router Dom: forgetting to add a link back to the home page from other routes.

The `bug.js` file shows an example where the 'About' page is missing a link back to the home page, leading to a poor user experience.

The solution is simple: add a link back to the home page. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a correct implementation.
